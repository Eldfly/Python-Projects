Create an hierarchy of classes - abstract class Employee and subclasses HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, Manager and Executive. 
Every one's pay is calculated differently, research a bit about it. 

After you've established an employee hierarchy, create a Company class that allows you to manage the employees. 
You should be able to hire, fire and raise employees.
